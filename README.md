# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Project
 
#### *Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.*

## Purpose
 
**The purpose of this project was to start learning tools that work hand and hand with Deep Learning and Neural Networks:**
 
  - Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
  - Describe the perceptron model and its components.
  - Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
  - Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
  - Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
  - Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
  - Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
  - Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
