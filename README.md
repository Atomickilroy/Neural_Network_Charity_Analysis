# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Project
 
#### *To create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.*

Working with Alphabet Soup’s business team, and a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

- Using Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

- Then using TensorFlow, design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.

- Lastly compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model again and try and optimize the accuracy (calculate the model’s loss and accuracy, for both.)

## Purpose
 
**The purpose of this project was to start learning tools that work hand and hand with Deep Learning and Neural Networks:**
 
  - Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
  - Describe the perceptron model and its components.
  - Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
  - Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
  - Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
  - Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
  - Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
  - Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
